      <h2>(PayPal)</h2>
      <p>
        You can find the PayPal payment button after you click the "Upgrade To
        Premium" button from the sidebar or <NuxtLink to="user/profile">Profile</NuxtLink>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes it takes a bit longer for the PayPal button to load, so you
        should keep the popup open until it loads.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PayPal payment is completely handled by PayPal and it's automatic.
        After the payment is completed your account will be automatically
        upgraded to premium.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PayPal payment is a one time payment. After 30 days it will expire
        and you need to manually renew your premium account.
